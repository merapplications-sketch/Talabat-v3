# TALABOT — driver: one notes log + one hand-off to the UI team (24 Oct 2026)

Branch `tech/v82-int`. Technical side done by Claude; design / visual application = UI team (ChatGPT). No publish, no SQL.
Local = Chromium + fixture (mock). Live = published app + real DB (not done).

## 1. Done (technical, local checks)
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| H1 cash breakdown / H2 offline strip / H3 delivery wording / H6 restaurant amount hidden | merged (UI team), tests follow |
| Waiting home (ab8fd6c) + real map binding (GEO, Leaflet / OSM, restaurants with valid coordinates) | v82c |
| H8 map failure: full message + «Повторить» only when nothing loads; partial = small notice; self-recovery | v82d–e |
| «Рестораны» wording; never «Поблизости нет ресторанов» until D-W1 | v82d |
| Map stability: frame once per task / stage; GPS moves markers only; user pan / zoom kept | v82f |
| Panel jump: panels re-created on each render slid from their CSS top (460 / 240 px) → no transition during re-render | v82g |
| Preview frame fix (export only); direct preview link on branch `preview-driver-waiting-map` | v82d |

## 2. Hand-off to the UI team (one list; nothing here was redesigned by Claude)
| # | Screen | Request | Technical side ready |
|---|---|---|---|
| H4 | customer v80 store page | UAT015 note sits inside the folded points line — confirm placement | — |
| H5 | admin / restaurant | v56 staff look now included (icons, side menu ≥ 1024 px) — confirm | — |
| H7 | driver A pickup stage | with H6 the collapsed sheet shows no headline amount — confirm or choose one | — |
| H9 | driver A mission screen | add a «Моё местоположение» control (as on the waiting screen) | call `aMapRecenter()` (assets/driver-tech/map-view.js): frames the task again and ends the user's free view |
| H10 | driver A waiting / mission | panel `transition: top` is skipped during re-renders by `html.a-rerender` (map-view.js); if the panels are restyled keep the `.w-sheet` / `.a-sheet` class names or tell Claude | done |
| H11 | waiting map texts | provider texts wMapFail / wMapFailHint / wMapRetry / wMapPartial / wMapPartialRetry (RU / EN) live in waiting-map.js — wording review welcome | done |

Files the UI team owns and Claude touched (logic only): `assets/driver-a/driver-a.js` (4 «nearby» strings, earlier chat-draft line),
`driver.html` (delivery lock, 2 script tags). Everything else of Claude is in `assets/driver-tech/`.

## 3. Open decisions (owner) — not worked around
- D-W1: source and radius of «nearby» restaurants (none in the repo; map shows all active restaurants with coordinates).
- D-L1: does the courier pay the restaurant (patch 38 frozen; amount hidden).

## 4. Still to test (not provable locally)
- iPhone Safari round (one batch): waiting map, offer arrival, mission map, panels, permission denied, airplane mode.
- T6 live pass on the published app (needs Chrome extension or the owner); LINK-02/03/05; LINK-06 iPhone.
- T7 merge of `tech/v82-int` after owner approval (no SQL).

## 5. Delivery & tracking requests (added 24 Oct, 13:58) — plan: `docs/plan/DELIVERY-TRACKING-PLAN.md`
- Batch A started: pin chain checked locally (customer point = stored order point = courier point, flow_check);
  read-only query `sql/verify_delivery_readonly.sql` ready for the owner (courier-position read path, recipient / chat
  policies, prep / status functions, realtime tables).
- UI requests for batches B–D (route line + distance / ETA + «Навигатор», customer tracking map + draggable card + current-order
  shortcut, recipient / code screens) are listed in the plan, section 3 — one hand-off with H9.
- Blocking questions Q1, Q3–Q8 in the plan, section 4 (plus D-W1, D-L1).
